// here comes the RULES: 
• each player is given 10~30 seconds to reach their
   assigned musical note 
• colorful numbered (1 - 8) pixels are the musical notes
   you have to reach
• different colored pixels = different musical notes
• 1 being the lowest & 8 being the highest musical note
• the slider on the right tells you if you are too low
   or too high 
• once all players reach the correct note, your choir
   move on to the next chord
• once completed all chords, playback your choir's
   creation by hitting the play button
• lastly, sing LOUD and CONFIDENTLY :-)
